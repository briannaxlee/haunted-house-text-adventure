<h1><a href="index.html">Haunted House</a></h1>
<h2><u>Wait for help</u></h2>
<p>You wait in the darkness, the cold water numbing your legs. Twenty minutes pass, then thirty minutes, then an hour and not a sound it to be heard except your harsh breaths. Suddenly, you feel a sharp pain on your leg like you're being electrocuted. You yell and try to wade away, but you see a swarm of eels slithering toward you in the gloom. You scream and sink in to the water, paralyzed.

<h1>THE END</h1>
