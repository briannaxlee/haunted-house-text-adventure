<h1>Haunted House</h1>
<h2><u>Story Intro</u></h2>
You go down a dead end and find yourself in front of an abandoned haunted house. The porch steps squeak as you
go onto the door and you find the front door unlocked as you turn the door knob. The foyer leads to two doors.
One is black with caution tape covering the whole door and the other one is white with dried blood on it. What
door do you choose?
