<h1>Haunted House</h1>
<h2><u>Story Intro</u></h2>
You picked the jigsaw puzzle. You give it to the dragon, distracting it long enough for you to slip through the
door that had opened. You go up a flight a stairs, leading you to the roof, only to find a corn maze. You walk through
the corn maze and look over your should to find that you're being followed by ghosts, goblins, and flying witches.
You're at the end of the road and see it split, one path going to the left and another going to the right. Which do you
pick: left or right path.
