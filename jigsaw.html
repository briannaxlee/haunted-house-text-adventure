<h2><u>Choosing the jig saw as your weapon</u></h2>
You pick up the jig saw. You point it toward the dragon, distracting it long enough for you to slip through the
door that had opened. You go up a flight a stairs leading you to the roof and find yourself in a corn maze. You walk through
the corn maze and look over your shoulder to find that you're being followed by ghosts, goblins, and flying witches.
You're at the end of the road and see it split, one path going to the left and the other going to the right. Which do you
pick?
