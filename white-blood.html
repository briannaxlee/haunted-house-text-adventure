You've gone through the white door with dried blood on it and it leads you to a room filled with hanging skeletons
that move and talk as if they're alive. You make your way through the room until you find a carnival ride. You get
into the cart and move the lever. The floor then opens up and you fall through to the basement. Once you're in the
basement, you get off the ride and take a step into the water, which reaches up to your knees and you realize that
there are eels in the water. Do you risk getting shocked by eels or do you get back onto the ride and wait for
someone to save you?
